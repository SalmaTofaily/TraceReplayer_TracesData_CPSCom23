# variability_aware_models_paper

Trace replayer for comparing power models predictions with real power measurements, for evaluating models accuracy.

Three updates of the power state model, to take variability of power in a state into consideration.

Ability to conduct tradeoff experiments between calibration trace sizes and models accuracy.

Ability to evalaute the standard deviation of results, when a replay is repeated n times.
